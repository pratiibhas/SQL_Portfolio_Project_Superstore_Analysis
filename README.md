# SQL_Portfolio_Project_Superstore_Analysis

The following project is a simple example of time series analysis in MySQL.Here we analyzed a stores dataset and complete the following tasks:

Use the LEAD window function to create a new column sales_next that displays the sales of the next row in the dataset. This function will help you quickly compare a given rowâ€™s values and values in the next row.

Create a new column sales_previous to display the values of the row above a given row.

Rank the data based on sales in descending order using the RANK function.

Use common SQL commands and aggregate functions to show the monthly and daily sales averages.

Analyze discounts on two consecutive days.

Evaluate moving averages using the window functions.
